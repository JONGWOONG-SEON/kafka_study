Consumers maintain membership in a consumer group and ownership of the parti‐
tions assigned to them by sending heartbeats to a Kafka broker designated as the
group coordinator (this broker can be different for different consumer groups). The
heartbeats are sent by a background thread of the consumer, and as long as the con‐
sumer is sending heartbeats at regular intervals, it is assumed to be alive.
